\chapter{Data sharing}

We can assume that $a$ will be globally modified after the datasharing program:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./datasharing 
a= 20 b= 10
a= 30 b= 10
a= 40 b= 10
a= 50 b= 10
\end{verbatim}

As we see every thread modifies $a$ since it is a global variable.
After adding the $firstprivate$ pragma, we can expect that $a$ will get $10$ one time:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ./datasharing 
a= 20 b= 10
a= 20 b= 10
a= 20 b= 10
a= 20 b= 10
\end{verbatim}

We see that $a$ is now private and equals to $20$ as the calculus $a += b$ is only made once.
